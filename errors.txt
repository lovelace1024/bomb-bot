- check why "you don't have that card you cheetah" appeared after I noped (I did have it and it did work).
#This happened as it checked for having the card after I noped, so I didn't have it at that point.
- add to turn to say who's turn is next
#added to turn.

ERRORS: (13/09/2023)
- Sometimes thinks there aren't enough players in the game even though it's clearly registered 2 people.
- Appears to not delete both cards in the pair if you have three?
- Noticed one time: said there was a tacocat pair even though there wasn't.
- How to make it not send an options list to someone who's just permanently exploded?
  (I can't figure out which bit of code is doing it)
- Nopes currently don't do anything.
- 3 Cat Card combos and Advanced rules (2/3 of any, 5 different ones) need to be included.
- If you're attacked and have to take multiple turns this should be mentioned in DMs and general
- Quite a lot of messages in the general channel
