-check why Brian got 10 cards. (he appears to have mine and his)
#hopefully resolved by resetting the player cards inside the code
- check why "you don't have that card you cheetah" appeared after I noped (I did have it and it did work).
#This happened as it checked for having the card after I noped, so I didn't have it at that point.
- add to turn to say who's turn is next
#added to turn.
- pair doesn't work: File "expk.py", line 422, in pair
    k = random.choice(cardlists[index])
TypeError: 'set' object is not subscriptable
#made playerx_cards into a list instead of a set.
- error in favor
await i.dm_channel.send(f"List of your cards: {', '.join(k for k in cardlists[num-1])}. Type $give followed by a number to indicate which card of yours to share.")
TypeError: sequence item 0: expected str instance, int found
#put str(k). Hopefully this should fix it.
- insert puts back the defuse not the exploding kitten
#fixed expk to take the value of the exploding kitten not the defuse used.

-Jenni exploded after defusing
- wouldn't let her reinsert
-exploded her
#move checking if no defuses to before defusing.
-pair doesn't work after people exploded

============
Increase nope time
Say who's turn when people explode
Remove nope time counters for skip and attack
Check why people sometimes can't use their cards!!
MAJOR ERROR FOUND i forgot how range worked so some of the cards were not included.
Patch fix: adding a dictionary to make the hand and give commands easier.
Only printing names of cards for see the future to reduce confusion.
