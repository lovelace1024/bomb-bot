Game setup - acting method
	When you advance to a new sequence, time is needed to digest the potion. The longer you wait, the lower the loss of control for the next 		advancement. You can also consume additional potions at the same level to strengthen your stats (but this increases the risk of berserk).

	
Cards can be traded between players, and players can trade within their character team too.
